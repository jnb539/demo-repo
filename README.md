I am John Box, and I am a hard worker who is also a very adaptable team member. I have grown up working on smaller engines and always tinkering around with backyard projects. I am an adept learner, and I have also worked three CO-OP terms as an Automation Technician. I am a proficient programmer and know a variety of codes.
