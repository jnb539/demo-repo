I am John Box, and I am a hard worker known for my  adaptability in team settings. I have also enjoyed tinkering on small engines and working on backyard projects, which have honed my skills as an adept learner. I have worked three CO-OP terms as an Automation Technician, which has given me hands-on experience working in the commercial field. I am a proficient programmer and know a variety of codes.
